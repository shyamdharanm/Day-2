Day 2 Task
Question 1: Write a blog on the difference between document and window object
Answer 
•	The document object represents the content of the web page, while the window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
•	The document object is always available in the global scope of a web page, while the window object is only available in the context of the browser 
        window or tab that contains the web page.
•	The document object has properties and methods that allow developers to manipulate the content of the web page, while the window object has 
        properties and methods that control the behavior of the browser window.
•	The document object can be manipulated and modified directly, while the window object is read-only and cannot be modified directly
•       The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. 
        With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
EXAMPLE FOR DOCUMENT OBJECT SYNTAX:
        document.property_name;

•       The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
        Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.
EXAMPLE FOR WINDOW OBJECT SYNTAX:
        window.property_name;
